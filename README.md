Analysis scripts of calcium imaging data in locomoting mice 
==============================

The repository contains custom written Python scripts used to extract calcium transients during forced locomotion. 

In the calcium-based plasticity model, pre- and postsynaptic spike induce calcium transients. Synaptic depression or potentiation is induced whenever the compound calcium trace crosses the depression or the potentiation threshold, respectively. 

The here published python scripts implement the steps and calculation to obtain '''locomotion fluorescence''' as depicted in Fig. 3 
 of the publication below.

Individual analsyis steps and scripts 
-----------

Experiments were done on ''four different animals'' in five different recording sessions. All animal specfic settings and analysis 
parameters are stored in the ```animalSettings.py``` file. 

### Alignment of images : '''python alignImages.py'''

This scripts uses the average image before and after drug application. 

```python
python alignImages.py
```

Change parameters and re-produce Figures
-----------

**PNAS 2012:**
The parameter values for the stimulation protocol can be changed in `Graupner2012PNAS_FigXX.py` (with XX=2,3 or 4B). Equivalently, the parameters of the plasticity model implementation can be changed in  `synapticChange.py` . The png and pdf versions of the figures can be produced by running the scripts
```python
python Graupner2012PNAS_Fig2.py
python Graupner2012PNAS_Fig3.py
python Graupner2012PNAS_Fig4B.py
```

**J Neurosci 2016:** The data has to be first calculated by running `irregularPairs_Ca-Model.py` for the linear calcium dynamics model and `irregularPairs_nonlinear-Ca-Model.py` for the nonlinear calcium dynamics model. For the linear calcium dynamics model, the calcium integral is calculated semi-analytically in a C++ program, which has to be compiled first by running `make` in the `timeAboveThreshold` directory. The compound figures are subsequently generated by the scripts `Graupner2016JNeurosci_linearCaModel.py` and `Graupner2016JNeurosci_nonlinearCaModel.py`. In other words, the png and pdf versions of the linear calcium dynamics figures can be produced by running the following two scripts
```python
python irregularPairs_Ca-Model.py
python Graupner2016JNeurosci_linearCaModel.py
```

Equivalently, for the nonlinear calcium dynamics model
```python
python irregularPairs_nonlinear-Ca-Model.py
python Graupner2016JNeurosci_nonlinearCaModel.py
```

Equivalently, for the calcium dynamics model with short-term plasticity for the somatosensory cortex plasticity data (Markram et al. 1997, Science)
```python
python irregularPairs_stp-Ca-Makram-Model.py
python Graupner2018_STPMarkramCaModel.py
```

Or for the calcium dynamics model with short-term plasticity for the visual cortex plasticity data (Sjoestroem 2001, Neuron)
```python
python irregularPairs_stp-Ca-Sjoestroem-Model.py
python Graupner2018_STPSjoestroemCaModel.py
```
